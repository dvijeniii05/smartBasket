## .smartBasket: Privacy policy

Welcome to the .smartBasket app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Adil Allahverdiyev. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The only type of data that users must provide is the email address and it is used for authetification through Firebase. The email is not encrypted but only accessible by myself and noone else. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Adil Allahverdiyev.
